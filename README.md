## Project description
Music-To-Go is a small website that allows for rental of musical gear or instruments. An account is required to login to access the system. There are 2 types of account users: Administrator and regular user (client). This was a **school assignment** done using mostly HTML and PHP.

	- Renting products
	- Returning of products
2. Functionalities:
	- Both admin/client should be able to register into the system
	- Both admin/client should be able to login into the system
	- Both admin/client should be able to logout.
	- Administrator should be able to insert products into the system
	- Administrator should be able to list all, available, overdue, or rented products
